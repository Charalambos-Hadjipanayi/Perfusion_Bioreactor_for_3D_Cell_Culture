# Perfusion Bioreactor for 3D Cell Culture Investigating Adipocyte Mechanobiology

Obesity is a recognised risk factor for many cardiovascular and metabolic conditions, and with its
increasing prevalence, studies are being performed to build on an existing body of research on adipocyte
mechanobiology. Specifically, it is hypothesised that cyclic compression of adipocytes reduces
intracellular lipid accumulation. As there are no readily available devices to investigate this theory, this
project aims to develop a perfusion-compression bioreactor capable of achieving physiologically
relevant strains (0%-12%) and frequencies (0.1Hz-1Hz) within a three-dimensional cell culture. A
system incorporating a pump and an actuator was connected to multiple hydrogel chambers, which were
computationally designed, and 3D printed. Rheological experiments were conducted to determine the
optimal collagen concentration of the hydrogels. Choosing the 4mg/ml concentration, Finite Element
Analysis (FEA) was used to model the behaviour of the hydrogel under compression. The results show
that physiologically relevant cyclic compressions can be performed on heights less than 3.2mm, for
strains of 0%, 4%, 8% and 12%. The compression system was tested separately and was found to have
a 1.2% accuracy. This, together with the FEA results and the theoretical predictions about the
functionality of the perfusion system anticipate that the final prototype will meet the design
requirements. Therefore, this device will allow the observation of adipocyte lipid accumulation in
response to cyclic compression, paving the way for further research on various cell types.
